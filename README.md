# Roaring's Rebalance AIs

This package contains custom AIs for the setting of the 2022 rebalance AI tournament.

Special thanks goes to:

- Crusader Pilaw ([Pilaw's Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@crusaderpilaw)), for the general idea of aranging AIs into tiers and for hosting fun AI battles
- Krarilotus ([Krarilotus' Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@Krarilotus)), as his aggressive AIs were the basis for my AIC files
- the UCP team, particularly gynt ([gynt's GitHub](https://github.com/gynt)), for creating an amazing modding framework
- Wurzelkasper, whose AI "Negus" I mostly copied for my "Bauernrebell"

Currently, the following AIs are included:

- EarlyMed, a European Count of the early medieval era. Commanding only a small number of knights and professional soldiers, he relies on Levies to form the bulk of his army. Tier: 4, Tactic: Balanced
- Piglet, the Pig's child. A small, but very quick opponent. Tier: 1.5, Tactic: Rush
- Ottoman, who represents the rise of the Ottoman Empire, including the takeover of Contantinople. Tier: 4, Tactic: Balanced
- Bauernrebell (meaning "peasant rebel"), who rises against his oppressive masters. Tier: 3, Tactic: Late Rush
- MaxRush, an AI designed for the hardest possible rush. Tier: 2, Tactic: Rush
